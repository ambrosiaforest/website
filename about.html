        <img src="xyla.png" alt="xyla" height=200 width=200>
        <p>Hey! My name is Xyla but I also still go by Amber, though I much prefer Xyla. I am 17 years old. Based near Chicago Illinois. My preferred pronouns are it/its but she/her or they/them are also okay.</p>
        <p>I am transgender and lesbian. My wonderful girlfriend is <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@EuropatheGaymer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Europa</a>.</p>
        <p>I am a communist, anarchist, and satanist</p>
        <p>I mostly hangout on a discord server called The Garden so that is where you will find me the most. <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me if you are interested in joining the server. It is entirely lgbtq+ and is a very safe place for people like me to hang around.</p>
