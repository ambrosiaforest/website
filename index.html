        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my cozy lil corner of the internet! I made this place to be free and open for all people of all races, ethnicities, gender, sexuality, class, etc. As someone who is apart of a few marganalized minorities, I really needed a safe space where I can be myself.</p>
        <p>Once I setup a homeserver and a domain I will be moving this site where I can host privacy respecting frontends for various services like librey or invidious.</p>
        <p>This website is almost constantly under construction so be sure to watch as this website grows along with my dev skills improving!</p>
